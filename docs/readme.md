# StakeCube Protocol (SCP)

StakeCube Protocol is designed to radically improve the functionality of StakeCube Coin (SCC). With SCP, we intend to provide the platform for a fully decentralized, user-friendly and scalable economy. Hodlers, developers and traders can take advantage of all the possibilities that SCP offers for tokenized assets and services. SCP eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries while allowing for the trustless transfer of value. DEXes, autonomous contracts and many other options are made possible through it. From a technical standpoint, SCP combines a UTXO based blockchain with an account-based system, on top of DASH-based technology such as InstantSend. This allows for great usability without sacrificing any technical capabilities.

## SCP wallet

The SCP wallet is at the center of this system, providing a place to store the tokens, stake them, exchange them, etc. To achieve this, the wallet needs to emphasize usability and security. We made the SCP wallet into a Zero-sync light-wallet to reduce the time and resources needed to use it. Moreover, a customizable but simple UI makes the SCP wallet an intuitive tool with a smooth onboarding process.

Security is reinforced through the use of 2FA; and a sophisticated
encryption system that makes it physically impossible for a thirdparty to access the wallet without the password. The wallet also
features an automatic staking APR/ROI calculator, and the possibility
to use custom themes with light and dark available as default.
